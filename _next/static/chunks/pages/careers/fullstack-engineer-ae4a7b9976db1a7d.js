Material\xa0UI, the most successful React implementation of Google&#39;s Material Design.\nIt has gained a large following, not only due to its fidelity to Material Design, but also because of the number of components, its carefully designed component API, its obsession with details, and community engagement.\nToday, countless teams and organizations rely on our open-source projects to build their design system.</p>\n<p>A couple of years ago, we started to expand our suite of products.\nWe released <a href="https://mui.com/x/">MUI\xa0X</a>, a collection of advanced components; <a href="https://mui.com/design-kits/">MUI Design kits</a>, the MUI components available for Figma, Sketch, etc.; and also host <a href="https://mui.com/templates/">Templates</a>, a set of pre-built UI kits.\nWe&#39;ve seen rapid growth with all of them (2x per year) and we have more to come.\nWe are building <a href="https://mui.com/toolpad/">a low-code platform</a> for developers to significantly increase the speed and lower the barrier for creating simple CRUD/dashboard UIs with MUI&#39;s libraries.</p>\n<p>We are a fully distributed team, spread across multiple time zones.\nWe work mainly asynchronously, relying mostly on written collaboration.\nEvery contributor has the freedom to define how they work — the rest of us won&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing day-to-day unless you tell us.\nFor additional details about the culture, you can check our <a href="https://mui.com/careers/">careers</a> and <a href="https://mui.com/about/">about</a> pages and also our <a

that can create custom UIs, the better.\nWe believe that the best way to improve on these dimensions is to eliminate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnO7D5UaDig&t=2451s">80%</a> of the code that has to be written.</p>\n<p>We&#39;re in the early stages of exploring what our role could be in the currently emerging low-code space. We&#39;ve assembled a team to work on a new product and plan to bring it to market in 2022. We have made our initial research and need help to accelerate the development of our MVP.</p>\n<p>Overall, both our open-source community and our premium products are growing fast (x2 YoY).\nWe need talented people to keep that going!</p>\n<h2 id="the-role"><a href="#the-role" class="title-link-to-anchor">The role<span class="anchor-icon"><svg><use xlink:href="#anchor-link-icon" /></svg></span></a><button title="Post a comment" class="comment-link" data-feedback-hash="the-role"><svg><use xlink:href="#comment-link-icon" /></svg></button></h2><h3 id="why-this-is-interesting"><a href="#why-this-is-interesting" class="title-link-to-anchor">Why this is interesting<span class="anchor-icon"><svg><use xlink:href="#anchor-link-icon" /></svg></span></a><button title="Post a comment" class="comment-link" data-feedback-hash="why-this-is-interesting"><svg><use xlink:href="#comment-link-icon" /></svg></button></h3><p>The Toolpad application offers a wide variety of engineering challenges.

A large amount of the work on Toolpad is reducing friction and making it easier to use. As our MVP grows, our focus will shift from &quot;making it work&quot; towards &quot;making it easy to work with&quot;.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaborate with the community</strong>. Toolpad will be open-sourced. As the community grows you&#39;ll act as a lead to steer it towards success. This includes reviewing issues, pull requests and questions, and guiding aspiring contributors to make meaningful contributions.</li>\n<li><strong>Experiment and play</strong>. Great, unexpected features and heisenbug fixes have come from a number of sources — relentlessly methodical processes of elimination, free-flowing team collaboration, inspiration by adjacent libraries and projects, and difficult-to-explain individual strokes of brilliance. Whatever your preferred style is for creating new things that others might not have thought of, you&#39;ll find a welcome home on the team.</li>\n<li><strong>Take ownership of features from idea/mockup to live deployment</strong>.
