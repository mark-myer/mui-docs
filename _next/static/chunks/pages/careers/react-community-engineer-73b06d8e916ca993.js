most successful React implementation of Google&#39;s Material Design.\nToday, Material\xa0UI stands as one of the most popular open-source libraries on GitHub and has paved the way for the fully-fledged startup known as MUI (founded in 2019), which now boasts an ever-expanding ecosystem of React UI products.\nWe&#39;re a company of 31+ people as of late 2023, and we&#39;re growing.</p>\n<h2 id="the-products"><a href="#the-products" class="title-link-to-anchor">The products<span class="anchor-icon"><svg><use xlink:href="#anchor-link-icon" /></svg></span></a><button

Material\xa0UI—but this is just one of three core component libraries we maintain.\nBase\xa0UI is our headless component library, and Joy\xa0UI is a sister library to Material\xa0UI that implements our own in-house Joy Design system.\nWe also host Design Kits and pre-built Templates.</p>\n<p>Beyond the core libraries, MUI\xa0X offers advanced components like the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, and Charts, for more complex user interactions and data visualization needs.</p>\n<p>We&#39;re also making ambitious moves to incorporate our full suite of components into Toolpad, a low-code admin builder tool for assembling full-stack apps faster than ever.</p>\n<p>Learn more about MUI&#39;s products in this blog post: <a href="https://mui.com/blog/mui-product-comparison/">An introduction to

with a team that spans the globe.\nThe majority of our work is asynchronous, and we rely on written communication to collaborate.\nWe&#39;re radically transparent: nearly all of our work happens in public.\nEach contributor has the freedom to decide how and when they work, and that work is primarily self-directed: it&#39;s your responsibility to define and complete your own tasks in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>For additional details about the culture, you can check our <a href="https://mui.com/careers/">careers</a> and <a href="https://mui.com/about/">about</a> pages and also our <a

growth, we (will) have more users questions and feedback coming in than ever before.</li>\n<li>The commercial version of the library is growing, but our community of developers is still small and has a reduced incentive to contribute compared to the community plan.</li>\n<li>Software engineers at MUI are tasked with doing support, however, they could benefit from the help of a dedicated person in the company, for instance to improve the workflows and tooling.</li>\n<li>The MUI\xa0X Premium plan will offer a technical advisor service, we need a Community Engineer to help deliver it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, both our open-source community and our premium products are growing fast (x2 YoY).\nWe need talented people to keep that going!</p>\n<h2 id="the-role"><a href="#the-role"

person that enjoys optimizing what already exists but is also eager to help our users with features that are requested by the community.</p>\n<p>Our products empower React developers to build awesome

responsibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Build product knowledge</strong>. You will continually research and learn the current and future best practices of using MUI.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolve users&#39; issues</strong>. You will solve these issues at two levels:<ul>\n<li>On the surface, you will answer developers on GitHub, Zendesk, X, email, Slack.</li>\n<li>At the root, you will create/update the documentation, fix bugs in collaboration with the relevant developer, implement community driven features and more.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Provide feedback</strong>. You will work alongside product managers to define and shape the product goals, roadmap, priorities, and strategy based on your frontline knowledge of customer needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Operations</strong>.<ul>\n<li>You will establish key support metrics and identify how best to measure them.</li>\n<li>You will establish a workflow to reduce &#39;time to response&#39; and &#39;time to fix&#39; that can scale to multiple team members.</li>\n<li>You will identify where internal tooling might be developed or obtained to improve support efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the right candidate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working with the Leadership to construct and execute a hiring plan to grow the community team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the day, you&#39;ll:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You&#39;ll be interacting with the users</strong> on a regular basis, handling inbound support and feature requests (every developer helps with developer requests).</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce friction</strong>.\nA large amount of the work on MUI is reducing friction and making it easier to use.\nThis might involve careful API design, identifying and fixing top bugs, creating easier-to-understand error messages, and writing documentation and blog posts about features you ship.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaborate with the community</strong>.\nMany small, as well as meaningful fixes and features, have been contributed by the community. Your role is to draw the best out of the community — to inspire those across the world to create and contribute through your reviews of their issues and pull requests.</li>\n<li><strong>Experiment and play</strong>. Great, unexpected features and heisenbug fixes have come from a number of sources — relentlessly methodical processes of elimination, free-flowing team collaboration, inspiration by adjacent libraries and projects, and difficult-to-explain individual strokes of brilliance. Whatever your preferred style is for creating new things that others might not have thought of, you&#39;ll find a welcome home on the team.</li>\n<li><strong>Ship. Early and often</strong>.
